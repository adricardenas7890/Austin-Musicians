Hey y'all!

We have some things we need to all agree on. 

1) We will be using Python 3.6+
2) If you make a virtual enviornment in the repository, please add it to the .gitignore
3) Once there is a stable virtual enviornment, lets create a requirements.txt file to list what we use.


The current structure of the project is based in Django. 
Where there are static files that cannot be added or removed during the hosting of the website (like a company logo). 
Media files can be added and removed during hosting (like a person uploading their profile picture).
And templates are just folders holding the HTML files we would like to serve for each section of the website.

Don't be afraid to change the structure of the project if it is uncompatable.

???? Add stuff in here if you can think of it.
